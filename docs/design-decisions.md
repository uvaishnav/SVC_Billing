## [2026-05-23] Settings Module — Single-row typed table

Chose a **single-row typed table** (`settings`, always `id = 1`) over a key-value store (`key TEXT, value TEXT`) because:
- All settings fields are known upfront from the PRD
- Type safety is critical for financial fields (`default_tds_rate NUMERIC`, `current_sequence INTEGER`)
- A key-value store would require runtime string parsing, risking silent bugs in invoice calculations

## [2026-05-23] Settings Module — Separate `bank_accounts` table

Chose a **separate `bank_accounts` table** (one row per account) over hardcoding `bank1_*` / `bank2_*` columns in `settings` because:
- Hardcoding a fixed count is bad practice — the business may add more accounts in future
- Each account has a `nickname` field used for dropdown selection in the invoice wizard
- `settings.default_bank_account_id` FK pre-selects the most-used account in the wizard
- Soft-delete (`is_active = false`) preserves history without breaking invoice FK references

## [2026-05-23] Settings Module — Separate `sac_codes` table

Chose a **separate `sac_codes` table** over a single default SAC field in settings because:
- The business uses multiple SAC codes (997319 for equipment rental, 9954 for construction)
- Each code has a `nickname` for human-friendly dropdown selection in the invoice wizard
- `settings.default_sac_id` FK pre-selects the default; user overrides per invoice as needed
- Pre-seeded with known codes at DB setup; user can add more without code changes

## [2026-05-23] Settings Module — `patchSettings` vs `upsertSettings`

Introduced two separate functions for writing to `settings`:
- `upsertSettings(values)` — used for full profile saves; does INSERT or UPDATE with all required fields
- `patchSettings(values)` — used for partial updates (e.g. set default bank, set default SAC); pure `UPDATE WHERE id = 1`

This separation prevents `NOT NULL` constraint violations when only a single field needs updating.

## [2026-05-23] Clients Module — Address belongs on `client_gstins`, not `clients`

Chose to store `address` (and `state`, `state_code`) on the **`client_gstins` table** rather than on `clients` because:
- A client registered in multiple states has a **different registered address per GST registration**
- Storing address on `clients` would require picking one arbitrarily, which is incorrect for multi-state clients
- The `clients` table now holds identity-only data: `name`, `phone`, `email`, `is_active`
- Each `client_gstins` row is a complete, self-contained GST registration: `gstin`, `state`, `state_code`, `address`, `is_primary`

**Impact on invoices:** When generating an invoice, fetch the specific `client_gstins` row the user selects — it provides the recipient address and GSTIN to print on the invoice. Do NOT read address from the `clients` table.

## [2026-05-23] Clients Module — `GstinDraft` pattern for form state

Chose a **single `GstinDraft` object** (with `commitDraft()` + `setGstins()` list) over separate disconnected state variables because:
- Separate variables caused race conditions on re-render — values were not atomically captured
- A single draft object is reset atomically on commit, preventing stale state bugs
- All `+ Add` buttons must carry `type="button"` explicitly — omitting this causes browser form-submit behaviour

## [2026-05-23] Clients Module — Auto-promote primary on GSTIN removal

When the primary GSTIN is removed from the list, the system automatically promotes the first remaining GSTIN to primary.

## [2026-05-23] Clients Module — UI design language: inline CSS + CSS variables only

Chose **inline CSS with CSS variables** over Tailwind utility classes for all UI components.
**Rule for all future modules:** Import from `settings/_components.tsx`, use CSS variables, no Tailwind classes on UI components.

## [2026-05-23] AppShell — Nav overlap fix

Fixed bottom tab bar covering page content: scrollable area has `paddingBottom: 64px`, tab bar is `position: fixed`.
**Rule for all future pages:** Never set `min-height: 100svh` on a page root. Use `min-height: 100%`.

## [2026-05-23] Clients Module — `upsertClientGstin` requires `onConflict`

Always pass `{ onConflict: 'col1,col2' }` when upserting into any table with a composite unique constraint. See Supabase Rule 3.

***

## [2026-05-24] Vehicles Module — Lean identity-focused schema

Chose a **flat `vehicles` table with no unit/rate fields** (except `default_monthly_rent`) because unit-based billing rates are work-order-driven, not vehicle-driven. See changelog 2026-05-24 Vehicles for full rationale.

***

## [2026-05-24] Invoice Numbering — Atomic Postgres RPC over optimistic frontend increment

Chose **atomic `UPDATE...RETURNING` via Postgres RPC** to prevent duplicate invoice numbers across concurrent devices. See changelog 2026-05-24 Invoice Numbering for full rationale.

## [2026-05-24] Invoice Numbering — `last_fy` TEXT column over computed-only FY detection

Chose to **store `last_fy` as TEXT on `settings`** so the Postgres function can detect FY change in the same atomic transaction.

***

## [2026-05-24] Work Orders — `wo_reference` over `wo_number` (deviation from PRD)

The PRD schema (Section 21.5) uses `wo_number`. We use **`wo_reference`** because:
- Real work orders from RSV Constructions use labels like "LC-14", "LC-150" — these are references, not sequential numbers
- "number" implies auto-generated or sequential; "reference" correctly conveys a client-assigned label
- This naming is more accurate for the actual data the user will enter

## [2026-05-24] Work Orders — Extra columns `rates_firm`, `tds_applicable`, `billing_type` (addition to PRD)

Added three columns not in the PRD schema because:
- PRD Sections 10.4 and 11.1 explicitly describe these as important work-order attributes
- `rates_firm` — all sample WOs state "rates are firm, no escalation"; needed for the rate-override warning in invoice creation
- `tds_applicable` — determines whether TDS deduction appears on invoices linked to this WO
- `billing_type` (`monthly_ra` / `milestone` / `adhoc`) — determines the invoice creation flow for this WO
- Storing these avoids having to re-read the WO PDF or ask the user each time an invoice is created

## [2026-05-24] Work Orders — `sub_work_ref` column on `work_order_items` (addition to PRD)

Added `sub_work_ref` (e.g. "SW:1", "SW:2") because:
- Real work order samples from the business use sub-work references within a single WO
- Needed for item disambiguation in the invoice line description builder (next session)
- PRD schema omitted it because it was not known at PRD writing time

## [2026-05-24] Work Orders — Client-side status computation via `computeWOStatus()`

Chose to **compute `status` client-side** on every fetch rather than storing it or using a DB trigger because:
- Status is a function of `valid_to` vs today — it changes daily without any DB write
- A stored column would become stale unless a cron job or trigger kept it updated
- `computeWOStatus()` is a pure function — always correct, zero infrastructure cost
- DB `status` column is only written by explicit `closeWorkOrder()` calls (the one status that CAN'T be derived from dates)

## [2026-05-24] Work Orders — Replace-on-save for `work_order_items`

Chose **delete-all + re-insert** for saving work order items over differential update (detect added/removed/changed rows) because:
- The WO form shows all items at once; user edits the full list, not individual rows
- Differential diffing requires stable row IDs on the frontend, which adds complexity
- Delete + re-insert is atomic and always correct; the window of "no items" is milliseconds inside a single function call
- cumulative_billed_qty is preserved because it is not exposed in the edit form — the replace only re-inserts items with `cumulative_billed_qty: 0` for new WOs; for edits, the existing items already carry their qty in the loaded form state

> ⚠️ **Important caveat:** Once invoices start updating `cumulative_billed_qty` on items, the replace-on-save strategy must be revisited. At that point, editing a WO's items must NOT reset billed quantities. This decision should be re-evaluated when the invoice creation module is built.

## [2026-05-24] Work Orders — AI parsing via Supabase Edge Function, not direct API call

For the upcoming OCR + AI parsing flow (Part 2), chose to route the AI parsing call through a **Supabase Edge Function (`parse-work-order`)** rather than calling OpenAI/Gemini directly from the browser because:
- Calling AI APIs from the browser exposes the API key in client-side code — unacceptable security risk
- Edge Function can validate the JWT, rate-limit, and handle API key rotation without frontend changes
- Same pattern already established by `generate-invoice-number` Edge Function
- Only the AI API key needs to be set via `supabase secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY ...`

## [2026-05-24] Work Orders — OCR runs in-browser via Tesseract.js

For the upcoming PDF-to-text extraction step, chose **Tesseract.js in-browser OCR** over server-side OCR because:
- PRD Section 23.2 explicitly specifies Tesseract.js as the OCR library
- Work order PDFs are typically clean scanned documents — Tesseract accuracy is sufficient
- Running in-browser avoids uploading large PDFs to a server before extraction; only the extracted text is sent to the AI
- PDF → text extraction happens before the Supabase Storage upload (upload only happens after user confirms the parsed data)

***

## [2026-05-26] PDF Invoice Generation — Compliance-first invoice face (deviation from PRD Section 8.2 item 6)

Chose a **stripped-down, compliance-first invoice face** over the PRD's fuller project-reference block layout because:

- **No project name / subject on invoice:** Project name and work order subject are internal records only. The invoice face should describe the taxable supply, not the internal project taxonomy. Printing a long subject line clutters the bill without adding GST-required information.
- **No explicit vehicle block on invoice:** Vehicle selection is used for internal analytics, usage tracking, and description assistance only. Vehicles may optionally appear inside the AI-generated description text when contextually relevant, but they will not appear as a separate printed section.
- **W.O. Reference printed in low-emphasis style:** When a work order is linked, its reference (e.g. "W.O. Ref: LC-14") is printed in a muted, small-text style in the invoice metadata block. This aids client-side reconciliation without dominating the invoice face.
- **TDS as informational summary line (not a GST field):** TDS (@ 2% on taxable value) is shown below the GST-inclusive invoice total as: `TDS @ 2% (deducted by client): ₹X` and `Net Receivable: ₹Y`. This is not a mandatory GST field but is operationally essential for the business to set payment expectations with the client.
- **Multi-row line items:** Each billed work-order item gets its own row (Sl. No, Description, SAC, Unit, Qty, Rate, Taxable Value). A single consolidated tax row appears at the bottom. This keeps per-item traceability intact.

**Locked invoice section structure:**
1. Header band — supplier identity (name, address, GSTIN, PAN, phone/email, logo)
2. Invoice metadata — invoice number, date, billing period, W.O. reference (muted)
3. Bill-to block — client name, address, GSTIN, place of supply + state code, tax mode, reverse charge
4. Line items table — Sl. No / Description / SAC / Unit / Qty / Rate / Taxable Value
5. Totals block — total taxable, CGST+SGST or IGST, **total invoice amount** (bold), TDS informational line, net receivable
6. Amount in words
7. Bank details — bank name, account name, account number, IFSC, branch
8. Declaration + authorized signatory name + signature line
